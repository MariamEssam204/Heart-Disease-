## Project Description

This project analyzes and visualizes data related to heart disease risk factors using Python's data analysis libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's [Heart Failure Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction), containing various clinical and health-related variables.

- **Data Analysis:** Exploring trends and correlations in the Kaggle dataset to understand factors influencing heart disease risk.
- **Visualization:** Creating informative visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and histograms to illustrate data distributions and relationships.
- **Machine Learning:** Implementing predictive models to assess the risk of heart failure based on provided features.
- **Insights:** Providing actionable insights derived from data analysis to better understand heart disease risk factors.

This repository serves as a comprehensive exploration of heart disease risk factors, utilizing Kaggle's Heart Failure Prediction dataset. The project aims to provide valuable insights into health data analysis and visualization techniques.
